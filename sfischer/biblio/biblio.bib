	abstract = {Flux balance models of metabolism use stoichiometry of metabolic pathways, metabolic demands of growth, and optimality principles to predict metabolic flux distribution and cellular growth under specified environmental conditions. These models have provided a mechanistic interpretation of systemic metabolic physiology, and they are also useful as a quantitative tool for metabolic pathway design. Quantitative predictions of cell growth and metabolic by-product secretion that are experimentally testable can be obtained from these models. In the present report, we used independent measurements to determine the model parameters for the wild-type Escherichia coli strain W3110. We experimentally determined the maximum oxygen utilization rate (15 mmol of O2 per g [dry weight] per h), the maximum aerobic glucose utilization rate (10.5 mmol of Glc per g [dry weight] per h), the maximum anaerobic glucose utilization rate (18.5 mmol of Glc per g [dry weight] per h), the non-growth-associated maintenance requirements (7.6 mmol of ATP per g [dry weight] per h), and the growth-associated maintenance requirements (13 mmol of ATP per g of biomass). The flux balance model specified by these parameters was found to quantitatively predict glucose and oxygen uptake rates as well as acetate secretion rates observed in chemostat experiments. We have formulated a predictive algorithm in order to apply the flux balance model to describe unsteady-state growth and by-product secretion in aerobic batch, fed-batch, and anaerobic batch cultures. In aerobic experiments we observed acetate secretion, accumulation in the culture medium, and reutilization from the culture medium. In fed-batch cultures acetate is cometabolized with glucose during the later part of the culture period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Group contribution methods were utilized to estimate the standard Gibbs free energy change of every reaction in the constructed model. Reactions in the model were classified based on the activity of the reactions during optimal growth on glucose in aerobic media. The most thermodynamically unfavorable reactions involved in the production of biomass in E. coli were identified as ATP phosphoribosyltransferase, ATP synthase, methylene-tetra-hydrofolate dehydrogenase, and tryptophanase. The effect of a knockout of these reactions on the production of biomass and the production of individual biomass precursors was analyzed. Changes in the distribution of fluxes in the cell after knockout of these unfavorable reactions were also studied. The methodologies and results discussed can be used to facilitate the refinement of the feasible ranges for cellular parameters such as species concentrations and reaction rate constants.},

	abstract = {Metabolism of living cells converts substrates into metabolic energy, redox potential and metabolic end products that are essential to maintain cellular function. The flux distribution among the various biochemical pathways is determined by the kinetic properties of enzymes which are subject to strict regulatory control. Simulation of metabolic behavior therefore requires the complete knowledge of biochemical pathways, enzyme kinetics as well as their regulation. Unfortunately, complete kinetic and regulatory information is not available for microbial cells, thus preventing accurate dynamic simulation of their metabolic behavior. However, it is possible to define wider limits on metabolic behavior based solely on flux balances of biochemical pathways. We present here comprehensive information about the catabolic pathways of the bacterium Escherichia coli. Using this biochemical database, we formulate a stoichiometric model of the bacterial network of fueling reactions. After logical structural reduction, the network consists of 53 metabolic fluxes and 30 metabolites. The solution space of this under-determined system of equations presents the bounds of metabolic flux distribution that the bacterial cell can achieve. We use specific objective functions and linear optimization to investigate the capability of E. coli catabolism to maximally produce the 12 biosynthetic precursors and three key cofactors within this solution space. For the three cofactors, the maximum yields are calculated to be 18.67 ATP, 11.6 NADH and 11 NADPH per glucose molecule, respectively. The yields of NADH and NADPH are less than 12 owing to the energy costs of importing glucose. These constraints are made explicit by the interpretation of shadow prices. The optimal yields of the 12 biosynthetic precursors are computed. Four of the 12 precursors (3-phosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate and oxaloacetate) can be made by E. coli with complete carbon conversion. Conversely, none of the sugar monophosphates can be made with 100\% carbon conversion and analysis of the shadow prices reveals that this conversion is constrained by the energy cost of importing glucose. Three of the 12 precursors (acetyl-coA, α-ketoglutarate, and succinyl-coA) cannot be made with full carbon conversion owing to stoichiometric constraints; there is no route to these compounds without carrying out a decarboxylation reaction. Metabolite flux balances and linear optimization have thus been used to determine the catabolic capabilities of E. coli .},

	abstract = {A modeling formalism has been developed recently, based on stoichiometry and linear optimization, that enables determination of the capabilities of metabolic networks. Both single and multiple simultaneous metabolic demands can be studied within this formalism. Here, we use this approach to determine the ability of Escherichia coli's fueling reactions to meet growth demands. "Growth" within this context is defined as a drain of biosynthetic precursors in an appropriate ratio required to produce cellular components. Maximizing biomass yield on glucose in the absence of maintenance requirements, we obtain a yield of 0·588 g DW g-1 glucose, which is higher than experimentally reported values. Inclusion of ATP maintenance costs significantly influences the maximal biomass yield. A maintenance cost of 4-6 ATP molecules per glucose consumed gives maximal biomass yields of 0·4-0·45 g DW g-1 glucose, which correspond to experimental observations of biomass yields. The corresponding metabolic flux distribution shows a remarkable consistency with experimental observations of pathway utilization, including the fraction of glucose metabolized through the pentose pathway, use of the anaplerotic reactions and redox metabolism. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates a robustness of the optimal biomass yield and pathway utilization to changes in metabolic demands. This result is important considering the diversity of metabolic demands that the cell can experience under different growth and environmental conditions. The optimal biomass yield varies significantly, approximately 20\%, over the range of P/O ratios found in energy-transducing membranes. A new metric that is based on shadow prices is formulated to measure the relative importance of the biosynthetic precursors to biomass generation. Interestingly, it identifies the sugar monophosphates as the best utilized biosynthetic precursors for growth in the absence of maintenance energy, although they are needed in relatively small amounts. With maintenance costs, ATP assumes a similar importance. With acetate as the sole substrate we show numerical comparisons of the optimal flux distribution with experimental determinations reported in the literature. We find the optimal solution to be in close agreement with experimentally determined pathway utilizations, the measured metabolic flux levels and biomass yields. Taken together, the results presented here argue for the hypothesis that observed metabolic behavior is consistent with stoichiometric optimality of growth and that regulation of metabolism strives to achieve this stoichiometric optimality.},

A stoichiometric matrix accounting for the major pathways involved in energy and mass transformations in the cell was used in our analysis. The auxiliary parameters of linear optimization, the so-called shadow prices, identify the intermediates and cofactors that cause the growth to be limited on each nutrient. This formalism was used to examine how well the cell balances its needs for carbon, nitrogen, and energy during growth on different substrates. The relative values of glucose and glutamine as nutrients were compared by varying the ratio of rates of glucose to glutamine uptakes, and calculating the maximum growth rate. The optimum value of this ratio is between 2–7, similar to experimentally observed ratios. The theoretical maximum growth rate was calculated for growth on each amino acid, and the amino acids catabolized directly to glutamate were found to be the optimal nutrients. The importance of each reaction in the network can be examined both by selectively limiting the flux through the reaction, and by the value of the reduced cost for that reaction. Some reactions, such as malic enzyme and glutamate dehydrogenase, may be inhibited or deleted with little or no adverse effect on the calculated cell growth rate.},

Experimental measurements of metabolite fluxes entering and leaving hybridoma cell line 167.4G5.3 have been used to interpret the interactions of nutrients and the demand for intermediates for growth. We have ascertained the effects of waste production and energy loads on the cell growth rate using linear optimization. This analysis has shown that neither the maintenance demand for ATP nor the antibody production rate limit growth rate at normal experimental conditions. In addition, the cell uses its nutrients for growth with only 57–78\% efficiency, due to the large secretion of alanine. The sensitivity of the growth rate with respect to the demand for cofactors and the supply of nutrients is given by the shadow price for each constraint. The shadow prices have shown that amino acids are the limiting nutrients at experimental conditions. The sensitivities of the growth rate to flux through reactions, given by the reduced costs, have shown that flux through the reaction glutamate dehyrogenase may actually slow down cell growth. We have also found that intermediates with lower shadow prices, and thus with lower value to the cell, are the precursors to compounds secreted from the cell. The shadow prices are also a means for comparing the costs of synthesizing various intermediates in terms of the two major nutrients, glucose and glutamine. At anaerobic conditions, glucose and glutamine have similar values to the cell, and the cost to synthesize most intermediates in terms of glucose is identical to the cost in terms of glutamine. At aerobic conditions, glucose is nearly twice as valuable to the cell as glutamine.},

Measurements of internal fluxes are needed and these additional measurements are used in conjunction with mass-balance equations to calculate the complete metabolic flux map. A method is presented that identifies the fluxes that should be selected for experimental measurement, and the fluxes that can be computed using the mass-balance equations. The criterion for selecting internal metabolic fluxes for measurement is that the values of the computed fluxes should have low sensitivity to experimental error in the measured fluxes. A condition number indicating the upper bound on this sensitivity, is calculated based on stoichiometry alone. The actual sensitivity is dependent on both the flux measurements and the error in flux measurements, as well as the stoichiometry. If approximate physiologic ranges of fluxes are known a realistic sensitivity can be computed. The exact sensitivity cannot be calculated since the experimental error is usually unknown. The most probable value of the actual sensitivity for a given selection of measured fluxes is estimated by selecting a large number of representative error vectors and calculating the actual sensitivity for each of these. A frequency distribution of actual sensitivities is thus obtained giving a representative range of actual sensitivities for a particular experimental situation.},

	abstract = {A method of analysis was presented in part I of this series for determining the fluxes in a biochemical network that are the optimal choices for experimental measurement. This algorithm is applied to two important biological models: Escherichia coli and a hybridoma cell line (167.4G5.3). Our results show that potentially poor choices for in vivo measurement of metabolic fluxes exist for both model systems. For the subset of reactions in E. coli that was studied, the condition number of the augmented stoichiometric matrix reveals that a 60-fold amplification of experimental error during computations is possible. The biochemical network of the hybridoma cell is more compelex than the E. coli system, and thus results in much larger possible error amplification—up to 100 000-fold. The physiological situations appear to have sensitivities that are less than 1/4 to 1/10 of those estimated by the condition number, and the maximum sensitivities are proportional to the condition number. These maximum sensitivities calculated using estimates of the fluxes and the worst possible error vector are upper bounds on the system's actual sensitivity. By examining the effect of measurement error on the sensitivity, the most probable sensitivity is calculated. These results indicate that an approximate two-fold increase in sensitivity of the E. coli system is likely when the worst set of fluxes are measured rather than the best set. The most likely sensitivity of the hybridoma system can range three orders of magnitude, depending on the set of fluxes that are measured. The propagation of experimental error during computations can be diminished for both systems by increasing the number of flux measurements over and above the minimum number of experimental measurements. The findings from these two model systems indicate that the calculation of the condition number can be a useful method for efficient experimental design, and that the usefulness of this method increases as the order of the system increases.},
