All these files are base on the same class \rbamacromolecules.


\subsection{RBAMacromolecules}
\label{sec:rba_macromolecules}

The outermost portion of the protein, RNA and DNA files is an instance of class
\rbamacromolecules, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:macromolecules}.

\rbamacromolecules{} has no simple attributes.
It contains exactly one instance of \textbf{ListOfComponents}
and \textbf{ListOfMacromolecules}.


\subsection{Component}
\label{sec:component}

The \component{} class is used to define the components of a \macromolecule{}
(Fig.~\ref{fig:macromolecules}).
For example, these are expected to be amino acids, vitamins and ions for
proteins.
Even if there is a strong connection between metabolic \species and \component{}s,
they are seen as independent entities with separate identifiers \species.
The connection between \species and \component{}s is established in the process file,
where \processingmap{}s define how components are assembled from metabolites.


\paragraph{The \textit{id} attribute}
The \textbf{id} attribute is a string defining the identifier of a component.

\paragraph{The \textit{weight} attribute}
The \textbf{weight} attribute is a real number defining the weight of a
component.
This information is essential for the density constraints.
The weight of a macromolecule is defined as the sum of the weight of its
components.
The weight unit is unspecified, however it should be consistent with the parameters
used in the density constraints.

\paragraph{The \textit{name} and \textit{type} attributes}
The \textbf{name} and \textbf{type} attributes are strings that provide
additional information about the component.
The name is a standard name of the component
(\textit{e.g.} full amino acid name).
The type can be used to distinguish components if necessary
(\textit{e.g.} in amino acids, vitamins, ions).


\subsection{Macromolecule}
\label{sec:macromolecule}

The \macromolecule{} class is used to define macromolecular species
(Fig.~\ref{fig:macromolecules}).
Its composition is given by a \textbf{ListOfComponentReferences}.

\paragraph{The \textit{id} attribute}
The \textbf{id} attribute is a string defining the identifier of
the macromolecule.

\paragraph{The \textit{compartment} attribute}
The \textbf{compartment} attribute must match the identifier of a \compartment.
It represents the compartment where the molecule is thought to be active.


\subsection{ComponentReference}
\label{sec:component_reference}

The \componentreference{} class is used to refer to a \component{}
and associate with it a stoichiometry (Fig.~\ref{fig:macromolecules}).

\paragraph{The \textit{component} attribute}
The \textbf{component} attribute must match the identifier of a \component{}
defined in the same \rbamacromolecules{} instance.

\paragraph{The \textit{stoichiometry} attribute}
The \textbf{stoichiometry} is a positive real number.
It represents the stoichiometry of a \component{}
(typically how often it appears in a \macromolecule,
e.g.\ the number of alanine residues in a protein).
